# Homelab Dashboard TODOs

- [x] **AI Assistant Sidebar Integration**
  - [x] Add a collapsible tab to the right side of the screen.
  - [x] Implement a chat interface allowing interaction with an LLM.
  - [x] Provide a model selector to switch between Claude, Agy, and a local model.
  - [x] Give the LLM context of what the user is currently looking at on the dashboard.
  - [x] Grant the LLM capabilities/tools to discuss the dashboard state, make changes to the dashboard, and manage the homelab.

- [x] **Media Stack (Backend & Security)**
  - [x] Deploy 15-container stack (Plex, *arrs, VPN).
  - [x] Enforce strict Gluetun Killswitch on qBittorrent.
  - [x] SRE Hardening (Docker Socket Proxy, Autoheal labels, Resource Limits).
  - [x] Wire live monitoring into Dashboard (DEFCON banner, container states).

- [ ] **Article Intake (Tag Filtering)** — ⏸ ON HOLD (Chris, 2026-08-02; revisit later)
  - [ ] Add a dedicated tag-filter UI to the article intake tab — tags currently only match via the free-text search bar, no way to browse/filter by tag directly.
  - [ ] Decide on presentation (filter chips, tag cloud, etc.) alongside the existing Homelab/News/Errors folder sidebar.

- [ ] **Media Stack (Frontend & GUI Config)**
  - [ ] Connect Prowlarr indexers to Radarr & Sonarr.
  - [ ] Link Radarr & Sonarr to qBittorrent via API keys.
  - [ ] Claim Plex server and configure library folders (`/data/media`).
  - [ ] Setup Discord/Telegram Webhook alerts inside Uptime Kuma.
